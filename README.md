# Problems-vs-Algorithms

## Problem 1: Square Root of an Integer
Find the square root of the integer without using any Python library. You have to find the floor value of the square root.  

## Problem 2: Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
You are given a sorted array which is rotated at some random pivot point.

Example: [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.


## Problem 3: Rearrange Array Digits
Rearrange Array Elements so as to form two number such that their sum is maximum. Return these two numbers. You can assume that all array elements are in the range [0, 9]. The number of digits in both the numbers cannot differ by more than 1. You're not allowed to use any sorting function that Python provides and the expected time complexity is O(nlog(n)).


## Problem 4: Dutch National Flag Problem
Given an input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, sort the array in a single traversal. You're not allowed to use any sorting function that Python provides.


## Problem 5: Autocomplete with Tries
Implement an autocomplete function using Tries. Create a TrieNode object that will return all complete word suffixes that exist below it in the Trie.


## Problem 6: Unsorted Integer Array
In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. The code should run in O(n) time. Do not use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.


## Problem 7: Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie
For this exercise we are going to implement an HTTPRouter like you would find in a typical web server using the Trie data structure.
